                                    The API operates on a seven-level readability corpus, which was developed together
                                    with people who have
                                    been learning the German language on the A and B level, additionally to their native
                                    language.

                                    The API while scanning the written text a user inputs, calculates the „Mean Opinion
                                    Score“ in short MOS,
                                    which directly shows the user in the range of 1-7, the readability of the scanned
                                    text.

                                    The 3 biggest features of the German language, with focus on text readability are
                                    the following:
                                    traditional, lexical and morphological features, the latter has the biggest impact
                                    for second language
                                    learners, because of its complexity.

                                    Traditional features, set the base line for text readability classification, and
                                    builds upon the
                                    following 6 features:
                                    average length of sentence
                                    average number of words per sentence
                                    sentence length
                                    number of syllables per sentence
                                    the “Fleisch-Kincaid score”
                                    average word length

                                    lexical features are based on the vocabulary properties and most of them are used to
                                    assess readability
                                    for second language learners, some of them are:
                                    number of adjectives
                                    number of pronouns
                                    lexical diversity
                                    ratio of total number of verbs to adverbs

                                    Morphological features are important, because they have a huge impact on text
                                    readability for second
                                    language learners, and a combination of “German finite state morphology (SMOR)” and
                                    “conditional random
                                    fields (clevertagger)” are used in this API.
                                    Some features are:
                                    pronominal adverbs
                                    preposition used to introduce infinite clause
                                    adjective used as noun
                                    interrogative adverbs

                                    Mainly 20 features are being used to calculate the Mean Opinion Score for text
                                    readability and they are
                                    tested against each other to see how accurate they are.

                                    Text readability is calculated by using linear regression, support vector
                                    regression, polynomial
                                    regression and random forest regression.

                                    Additionally, the API is using the “Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)”, to measure the
                                    deviation of
                                    predicted values from actual values, while predicting errors which come by combining
                                    traditional,
                                    lexical and morphological features to measure the performance of the algorithm to
                                    rate the readability.</p>
